# Advent of Code Leaderboard app
This is a React app that stitches multiple Advent of Code leaderboards together to get past the 200 person limit.

# Disclaimer
It is not a well-architectured, well-written, neat, nice, fluffy, industry-strength piece of code. Instead it's something fun I wanted to make, stepping out of my normal way of coding. NO WARRANTY!
